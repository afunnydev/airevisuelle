## Contact lenses, is it for me?

Contact lenses can be an ideal solution to correct your vision, or a complementary tool to your glasses for sports or outings. There are several types of lenses for almost any type of prescription.

We currently find on the market several types of contact lenses; mainly day, biweekly or monthly disposables. Many manufacturers offer different qualities and characteristics of lenses. What you choose (or will be recommended) will depend on your prescription and your needs.

If you want to start wearing contact lenses, our opticians will also be happy to teach you how to put on, remove and maintain them.

To renew a lens order, or to seek advice from one of our professionals, [send us a message](https://www.lairevisuelle.com//en/contact-us).
